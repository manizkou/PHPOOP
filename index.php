<!-- 
	Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions. 
-->

<!-- 
	You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.
 -->

<!-- 
	Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.
 -->

<!-- 
	class:	Fruit

	objects: Apple, Banana, Mango 
-->

<!-- 
	So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

	When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties.

	Look at the next chapters to learn more about OOP.
